Version: 0.1

An enhancement for Autodesk's MotionBuilder Python implementation.
PyMoBu offers stronger and more user-friendly object classes and
functions that wrap around existing MotionBuilder objects.

It is easy to convert your existing object to a PyMoBu one by
calling the 'ConvertToPyMoBu' method on that object.

The intention of this release is to get an initial trial of the
concept for PyMoBu and gain feedback about its direction. Some
areas are not completed or may be broken, so I need your comments
to point these areas out.

More classes and component types will be added as the project grows.
This is merely the beginning to cover some of the areas.
