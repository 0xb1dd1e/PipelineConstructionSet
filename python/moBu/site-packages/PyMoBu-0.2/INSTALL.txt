Upgraded to run in MotionBuilder 2013

--------------------------
Note: PyMoBu has only been tested in MotionBuilder 2010.
      It will not work in older versions of MotionBuilder and
      has not been tried in 2011 yet.

Copy the folder 'pymobu' to any location that is in the
Python path that MotionBuilder can import. ie: sys.path

Once you copied the folder into a sys.path folder
and started MotionBuilder. You should be able to import
PyMoBu by simply doing:

import pymobu

You should be able to access all the functionality to convert
your objects and use the new functions.
